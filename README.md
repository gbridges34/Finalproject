# This app explores the effect of multiple factors on the price of a house. The data is simply listed homes with an id number, a sale price, and a variety of other attributes about the house (number of bedrooms, lot size, etc.) I chose the factors I thought would be most interesting out of the 80 that came in the original data set.
